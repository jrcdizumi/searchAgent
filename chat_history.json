However, there are references to \"SAKI-RAG,\" which relates to a framework in natural language processing, particularly in the context of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models. \n\nThe SAKI-RAG framework aims to mitigate context fragmentation in long-document processing, enhancing the coherence of information retrieved from larger documents. This is particularly relevant for applications in machine learning and information retrieval.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the following paper: [SAKI-RAG: Mitigating Context Fragmentation in Long-Document](https://aclanthology.org/2025.emnlp-main.63.pdf). If you meant something else by \"saki-rag paper,\" please provide more context!"
